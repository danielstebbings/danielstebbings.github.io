# **About Me**

Hi, I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** ,<br>
I'm a driven and passionate fourth year student studying towards a MEng in Electronic and Digital Systems particularly interested in the space industry, FPGA digital design and communications. 

I am the the electronics sub-team lead for StrathSEDS, a society developing high powered rockets and complex electronic systems. This year, I'm also developing the downlink communications system for STRATHcube; a student lead cubesat project at the University of Strathclyde trying to tackle one of the most important issues in the industry, space debris.
